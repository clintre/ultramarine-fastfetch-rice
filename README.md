# ultramarine-fastfetch-rice
Fastfetch rice for Ultramarine. 
Recommend using a Nerd Font. In the example, FiraCode Nerd Font is being used.
Some terminals, especially GTK based terminals do not support images well in FastFetch. I have set the logo-type to auto, as a failback. The logo is not as crisp on those terminals.
Terminals like Kitty, Wezterm, and Konsole have been tested to work.
