# ultramarine-fastfetch-rice
Fastfetch rice for Ultramarine. 

Recommend using a Nerd Font. In the example, FiraCode Nerd Font is being used.

For clear image, this uses the kitty image protocol. 
Known to work on: kitty, konsole, wezterm
Uses auto mode on: Gnome Terminal, Ptyxis, Alacritty

I have set the logo-type to auto, as a failback. The logo is not as crisp on those terminals.
